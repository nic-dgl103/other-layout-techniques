# Exercise 9: Other Layout Techniques

## Objectives
You will use the provided HTML and CSS as a starting point and you will code a webpage using a variety of layout techniques. The page will be made up of a series of different content blocks that you can choose from some provided layouts.

## Instructions
Remember to:
* Regularly save your files and check out what your web page looks like in a web browser.
* Make regular commits and pushes. **Your instructor will be looking at how you wrote your commit messages!**
### 1. Get set up
* Clone your remote exercise repository onto your local machine.
* Add a comment in the head element of the homepage including: the course code and your section number - your name - Other Layout Techniques. Example:
```
<!-- DGL 103 CVS1 - your name - Other Layout Techniques -->
```
### 2. Choose your content block layouts
You can choose your content blocks by visiting this site: https://xd.adobe.com/view/4bfd0256-8d04-47cf-b57a-7d4982a89d29-1eae/flow. 
The first 2 content blocks (header and hero have already been coded using floats), you have to code the remaining 4 content blocks. There are two layouts provided for each of the remaining 4 blocks. These are the same blocks that we used for exercise 7 and you can reuse your code from that exercise, however you may have to clean both your HTML and your CSS before using it.

**Important:**
1. You must code one content block using floats
2. You must code one content block using positioning
3. You must code one content block using css grid
4. You must code one content block using flexbox

**Page layout:**
1. Header - already coded
2. Hero - already coded
3. How it works
4. Resources
5. Call-to-action
6. Footer

### 3. Format, organize and add comments 
* Use the Prettier VSCode extension to format HTMl and CSS code.
* Add organizational CSS comments and order your style rules so that your CSS is easy to read.
* Add a few comments to explain your HTML and CSS code and highlight anything of interest.

### 4. Check for errors
* Use the VSCode HTMLHint extension and validate your HTML code to make sure that it is correct: https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_upload. Take a screenshot of the results.
* Validate your CSS code to make sure that it is correct: https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ for CSS. Take a screenshot of the results.

**You have now completed your exercise but you still need to push your edits to GitHub and submit it in Brightspace. Make sure to follow the instructions in the How to Complete Your Exercises Guide.**
